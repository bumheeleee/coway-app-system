#### What service do you provide?
- Most of Coway's products require constant maintenance. (Filter replacement, water quality management, etc.) However, in order to use the service, it is available through Kakao Service. I felt uncomfortable in this part, so I implemented an API that even provides product management functions within the product purchase app service.
